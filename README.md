# Blacksmith Project's Fraction kata php

This kata is described in the book [Software Craft: TDD, Clean Code et autres pratiques essentielles](https://www.dunod.com/sciences-techniques/software-craft-tdd-clean-code-et-autres-pratiques-essentielles).

## Instructions

We need to write an application capable of doing the 4 basic mathematical operations:
- addition
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division

The program MUST give the result as an irreducible fraction and might need to be simplified.

Examples:

- `4/7 + 2/7 = 6/7`
- `4/7 - 2/7 = 2/7`
- `4/7 * 2/7 = 8/49`
- `4/7 / 2/7 = 2`
